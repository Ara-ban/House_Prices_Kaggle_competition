# Boston House Prices Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository is a first step in my journey in acquiring advanced data science skills, particularly applied to the domain of market finance, a field I am passionate about. The primary goal is to explore various modeling techniques using the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices in Boston. The insights and methodologies employed here will serve as a foundation for understanding and modeling tabular financial data, particularly in asset price prediction.
